<h4>Project Title: Instruction Lists</h4>
<h5>Author: Sam Camus (xdothackerx) </h5>

Approach: Read an article on routing at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html. Attempted to use that information to create a simple page from scratch that would keep track of lists and their steps. Got really frustrated and went nowhere the first day. Somehow it became waaaaaay easier the next morning, randomly.

Collaborators: Everyone in class pretty much, esp. Steve, Tony, Alex, and Marco. Kangie tried to help me untangle all my errors yesterday. In the morning Cherri helped when I got stuck.
